            <h2> What is a runtime environment? </h2>
            
            <p>
                <strong>Runtime environment</strong> is a state of the target machine
                which may include software libraries, environment variables, etc., to 
                provide services to the processes running in the system.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The runtime support system is similar to a package in that it is generated
                with the executable program itself and manages the communication between the
                process and runtime environment. The support system also takes care of memory
                allocation and deallocation while the program is being executed.

            <h2> Activation Tree </h2>
        
            <p>
                When a program is ran, we assume that the program control flows in
                a sequential manner and every called procedure receives a procedure's
                controls. After executing a called procedure, it returns the control
                back to the caller. It is easy to visualize this control flow in a
                representation of a tree, an <strong> activation tree</strong>.
